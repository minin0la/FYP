<h1>Examples<a class="headerlink" href="#examples" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Examples are the main way that I learned about Tkinter and how to
write code for building GUI&#8217;s .  Unfortunately, it is hard to find
examples.  Grayson&#8217;s book has been an immense help over the years and
more recently the pyttk-samples distributed by Guilherme Polo have
helped greatly.  The official Tcl documentation is pretty much limited
to man pages which are of minor assistance in getting started with
Tkinter. The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tkdocs.com/tutorial/index.html">tutorial on the Tcl Developers site</a> only recently included
Python code. Much experimentation was required before I was able to
see a paned window on my screen or a scrolled directory.  There are
several interesting examples in the examples subdirectory.</p>
<p>So one may experiment with the examples changing sizes, colors, fonts,
etc. in the GUI modules and they should still work if he does not
regenerate support modules.  At least, one can see some of the
possibilities.  Of course, I have created some of them like menus in
poor taste just to illustrate some of the possibilities. You may
encounter some difficulties which may be due to the absence or miss
match of fonts, etc. between my system and yours.</p>
<p>The easiest way to try the examples is to go to one page/examples
subdirectories and (1) run page against the a &#8216;.tcl&#8217; file in
that directory and (2) execute the generated GUI module.  Most of the
examples have only one &#8216;.tcl&#8217;. Several examples have two GUI&#8217;s and
usually has a &#8216;main.tcl&#8217;; vrex the main GUI is &#8216;vrex.tcl&#8217; and in &#8216;two&#8217;
the main GUI module definition is &#8216;w1.tcl&#8217;.</p>
<p>If you try saving  the examples by executing PAGE on the Tcl files be
aware that generating and saving support files will replace the
included support files which will become backup versions and the
functioning of the applications will be lost unless the respective
files are restored.</p>
<div class="section" id="directory-browser">
<h2>Directory Browser<a class="headerlink" href="#directory-browser" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This example contains a scrolled treeview widget that displays ones
UNIX directory tree.  The source for this example is in
examples/directory-tree.py It is a rework of Polo&#8217;s example to include
folder icons which open and close.  Polo&#8217;s example is Based on

<div class="section" id="vrex">
<span id="id1"></span><h2>Vrex<a class="headerlink" href="#vrex" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the past I have used a number of regular expressions in Python and
used to great advantage <a class="reference external" href="http://laurent.riesterer.free.fr/regexp/">Visual Regexp</a> in composing and testing
those regular expressions and thought that rewriting the program in
Python would be interesting because</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It would illustrate important capabilities of PAGE.</li>
<li>It would be a useful program in its own right. Indeed, I use it all
the time.</li>
<li>The original version was written in Tcl/Tk and so uses the regular
expression processing of Tcl which is bound to be slightly different
from that in Python. So an all Python version using the Python
regular expression processing would be true to Python.</li>
<li>The original program had ZERO documentation. I never could figure
out all of the facilities present. (The most recent version has one
page of documentation.) I wanted a version that I could document.</li>
<li>This example illustrates several points about PAGE support: Building
menus, using paned windows, text colorization, synchronization
between two scrolled text windows, and a project utilizing two windows.</li>
</ul>
<img alt="_images/Vrex_for_Python.png" src="_images/Vrex_for_Python.png" />
<p>The main portion of the GUI is a three pane window for entering the
regular expression and sample in the first two and the third pane
presents match results based on the selection of buttons at the
bottom.</p>
<p>Some of the features of PAGE illustrated in this useful program are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Scrolled text widgets nested inside of label frames.</li>
<li>Use of two separate GUI&#8217;s, one for the main function of the program
and one for a help window.</li>
<li>Colorizing the text within the scrolled text windows.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="vrex-operation">
<h3>Vrex Operation<a class="headerlink" href="#vrex-operation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Briefly, Vrex works as follows:</p>
<p>One enters the regular expression under test into the top text box,
and the sample which is the subject of the regular expression match
into the middle text box.  One may use the File menu to load files
into the text boxes, one may directly type entries or use the normal
cut and paste facilities of the operating system.  The user can also
save the regular expression and sample using the File menu.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Pressing the Go button causes the match to be attempted.  Also,
colorization is applied to both the regular expression and to the
sample. The regular expression is colorized to show the portions of
the regular expression are to extracted individually. And if the
match is successful the corresponding portions of the sample are
displayed in the same colors.</li>
<li>By selecting one of the row of buttons marked match, 1, 2, ..., 9,
the portions of the sample corresponding to extracted subpatterns are
displayed in the match window.</li>
<li>You can use the File menu to load to save both the regular expression
and the sample.</li>
<li>The Quit Button terminates the program.</li>
<li>The File menu also has a Quit entry that terminates the program.</li>
<li>The Help menu opens a second GUI containing a ScrolledText widget
which has help information.</li>
</ul>
<p>The regular expression should be colorized showing the portions to be
extracted in different colors and as well as the matching portion of
the sample.</p>
<p>If you then Select Match, that matching portion of the sample will be
shown in the Match text box. Select 1, and the portion matching the
sub expression will be shown, etc..</p>
<p>You can also load a file into the sample window and thus run the
regular expression against many strings.</p>

<div class="section" id="progress-bar">
<span id="progress"></span><h2>Progress Bar<a class="headerlink" href="#progress-bar" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This example shows the usage of the progress bar widget but is included
mainly for illustrating an application with two top level windows.  It
shows how the main window is able to interact with variables and
procedures in the imported module which actually displays the progress
bar.</p>
<p>Important features illustrated include the creation and destruction of
the secondary top level window and the fact that the main GUI support
code requires access to Tkinter variables defined and manipulated in
the support module of the other, progress bar, window.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="complex">
<h2>Complex<a class="headerlink" href="#complex" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This really isn&#8217;t much of an example doing nothing but does showing
nesting of a paned window inside of a paned window and a notebook
widget nested inside of a paned window. By the way, one can enlarge
the top level window and copy and paste the whole paned window to a
new location.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="menus">
<h2>Menus<a class="headerlink" href="#menus" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are two directories page/examples/menu and page/examples/popup
which demonstrate menus</p>
<p>The menu directory contains a fairly extreme menu bar example.  Note, I do not
advocate this as a style to be used; it merely suggests some of the
things that can be done.</p>
<p>While this example works as expected on my Linux Mint 13 machine, it
does not work as well on my XP machine. The way it was conceived,
there is a small image to the right of the label in the left of the
menu bar. However, on XP neither the label nor the image is shown.
What one gets is &#8220;(image)&#8221;.  Strange since if you go down several levels
there is an image to the left of one of the check buttons. I think
that is a problem with Tk.</p>
<p>The popup directory example has a top level window with two buttons
and a different context menu attached to each.  To see the popup
menus right click on the buttons.  You will note that the two menus
have different colors.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="standard-tcl">
<h2>standard.tcl<a class="headerlink" href="#standard-tcl" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is just a top level window with each of the standard Tk widgets
that I support.  It just shows that I can generate working Python code
for each.   The lowercase &#8216;s&#8217; emphasizes that it doesn&#8217;t do much.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="themed-tcl">
<h2>themed.tcl<a class="headerlink" href="#themed-tcl" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As above for the themed widgets.</p>

<div class="section" id="canvas">
<h2>Canvas<a class="headerlink" href="#canvas" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Paul Krieger donated a canvas example which can be found in the
&lt;page_dir&gt;/examples/canvas directory. I am very thankful since I have
no facility with the canvas widget.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="wcpe">
<span id="id2"></span><h2>WCPE<a class="headerlink" href="#wcpe" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>See the WCPE directory in the examples directory.  This is a program
that displays the program of WCPE which is one of my favorite
classical music stations.  In this example all of the functional code
is located in WCPE_support.py and the GUI is defined in WCPE.py which
is the main module.  I found it very tricky to deal with time zones
and did not want to loose any of that code and have to redo it or to
deal with diff&#8217;s; at the same time, I was constantly tweaking the
GUI.  I generated the import module once and proceeded fill out the
&#8220;init&#8221; function and the callback functions in WCPE_support.py while
tweaking the GUI, i.e., changing its location, color, the size of the
display fields, and change of some display fields from entry boxes to
labels.</p>
<p>This example requires the Python time zone package pytz which is
available from <a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytz/">Python Package Index</a>.</p>
<img alt="_images/WCPE.png" src="_images/WCPE.png" />
<p>This example utilizes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Labels linked to Tkinter variables to display information like times,
composer, artist, etc.</li>
<li>A Scrolled text box which displays the whole play schedule for the
day and colorizes the current piece and makes sure it is displayed
within the window.</li>
<li>Busy cursor to alert the user that the application is awaiting
playlist information from the web.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition I fuss around with reading and parsing web pages and time
zone calculations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="clone">
<span id="double"></span><h2>Clone<a class="headerlink" href="#clone" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is a somewhat kooky example located in examples/clone, where
main.py creates a GUI which presents a button &#8220;Make Two&#8221; which cause
the creation of two instances of the &#8220;called&#8221; GUI but with differing
characteristics of location and background colors.  The called GUI is
then able to create incidences of clones with different locations and
background colors.</p>
<p>It is also an example of passing a user parameter to the creation
module which is then passed to the &#8220;init&#8221; function in the support
module where the color and location are manipulated.</p>
<p>There may be a problem executing this example on Windows if fonts
selected in the tcl are not available on the Windows machine. In that
case the font will default to TkDefaultFont.  Courier New is available
on both my Linux system and my XP box.</p>
<p>This example show two way of defining the textvaribles associated with
the label widgets in the called GUI.  One way is to define
(automatically) as a Tkinter variable in the support module. The second is
to define, again automatically, as a variable in the GUI module by
defining it as &#8220;self.&lt;variable&gt;&#8221; in the attribute editor.  PAGE
supports both, but I now see no advantage to using the second way, and
I think it is a bit more confusing.</p>

<div class="section" id="bind">
<span id="bind-example"></span><h2>Bind<a class="headerlink" href="#bind" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This subdirectory contains a bind example where the button
responds to selection with &lt;Button-1&gt; via the command attribute
set in the Attribute Editor and to &lt;Button-2&gt; and &lt;Button-3&gt; via
bind commands created using the Binding Window.</p>
<p>The function named in the command attribute is different from that
in the bind statement because in the latter case an event object is
passed as a parameter to the event handler so the handler must have an
argument to accommodate the event object.</p>

<span id="custom-example"></span><h2>Custom Widget<a class="headerlink" href="#custom-widget" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="scrolledframe">
<h3>ScrolledFrame<a class="headerlink" href="#scrolledframe" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This example, in &lt;page-dir&gt;/examples/custom/canvas, shows how I used a custom
widget called ScrolledFrame which I borrowed from the web. This widget
is used to display 100 buttons on a scrolled canvas.</p>
<p>When the user open PAGE with canvas.tcl, he sees</p>
<img alt="_images/canvas-tcl.png" src="_images/canvas-tcl.png" />
<p>which shows the toplevel window filled with a custom widget. Since the
structure of the widget is unknown to PAGE, it cannot be shown or
manipulated other than sizing or placement.</p>
<p>When the support module custom_support.py is completed with the Python
Tkinter implementation, execution yields</p>
<img alt="_images/custom-widget.png" src="_images/custom-widget.png" />
<p>The main module is canvas.py and the magic is contained in
canvas_support.py, which contains the Python/Tkinter code to implement
the class</p>
<p>In canvas.py the custom widget is referred to in the line:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Custom1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">canvas_support</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Custom</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">top</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In canvas_support.py the line of code:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">Custom</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Frame</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>is generated by PAGE causing the Custom widget to implemented as a
Frame widget. In other words, the name Custom refers to the Class
frame. This allows PAGE to display the Custom widget as a Frame widget
with the annotation of &#8220;Custom widget&#8221; and the execution of the
generated Python code to display the Custom widget as a Frame prior to
including the tkinter implementation in the support module.</p>
<p>The user-added implementation of the ScrolledFrame class at the bottom
of canvas_support.py begins as follows:</p>

<p>That last line of code in canvas_support.py causes the name &#8220;Custom&#8221;

<span id="id3"></span><h3>Lib Demo<a class="headerlink" href="#lib-demo" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This is a second example using the ScrolledFrame widget.</p>
<p>For testing of PAGE, I recoded a photo library program which I wrote
several years ago using PAGE to generate the seven GUI&#8217;s required for
the program.  For this example, I have stripped it down to just one
GUI which provides multiple display of just one image.</p>
<p>The demo generates the following window:</p>
<img alt="_images/lib_demo.png" src="_images/lib_demo.png" />
<p>It displays repeated copies of the thumbnail image of a particular
photograph as images on a Button widget. If one selects an image
button with Button-1, a message appears containing the index of the
button. If one selects a button with Button-3, a popup menu appears.
The Zoom cascade menu in both the toplevel window and the popup menu
allows one to change the size of the images displayed.  There is only
one image included in the example and it is displayed 30 times.</p>
<p>When the toplevel window is filled, the program determines, the
maximum number of images that will fit horizontally and puts that
number in each row. If the image is too big to fit, one image per row
is displayed but spills over the edge.</p>
<p>I have included the Busy Cursor code which is located in the shared
module. However, the refresh is so fast, one can hardly see the
different cursor.</p>

window 2 and passing it a parameter which is used to set a label. It
also has another example of the TProgressbar widget.</p>

<p>This example was written as a music server for my Raspberry Pi which
drives my audio system from CD images stored on a Linux box. I use this
program daily.  In this example I have a number of different bindings
and utilize a number of text widget tricks that I discovered by
experimentation as well as using multiple threads to run the mp3
player while keeping the GUI fairly responsive.</p>
