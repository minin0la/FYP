<h1>The PAGE Interface<a class="headerlink" href="#the-page-interface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This section discusses the menus and several of the windows in the
PAGE interface.  Again, the PAGE interface is a modified version of the
Visual Tcl interface.  It was modified because some of the original
facilities and features of Visual Tcl are inappropriate for PAGE or
because the Visual Tcl documentation is in such a sad state that I
cannot decipher them.</p>
<p>When PAGE is executed initially, a number of windows are spread across
the screen in what may appear as random locations and sizes. I have
arranged them at the corners and the edges so that they will be out of
the way of the GUI you are building.  They should then be resized and
moved to more desirable locations.  Follow such placement with
Windows-&gt;Save Window Locations or File-&gt;Quit and the geometry of the
windows will be saved in the .pagerc file and used when PAGE is next
invoked.</p>
<p>Many PAGE parameters are are saved from one invocation of PAGE to the
next in the file &#8220;HOME/.pagerc&#8221;. Included are the preferences and the
geometry (size and location) of the various windows in the page
interface as described above. This file is saved when the user does
a quit.</p>
<p>Start PAGE by executing &#8216;page&#8217; on Linux, winpage.bat in a DOS window,
or activating the PAGE icon on the Windows desktop. The page and
winpage.bat scripts may specify a filename. If the filename includes
an extension, it must be &#8221;.tcl&#8221;; in the case of no extension or a
final &#8221;.&#8221;, the extension &#8221;.tcl&#8221; will be appended to the filename.</p>
<p>The user is then greeted with a number PAGE windows and the main menu.</p>
<p>The default interface for PAGE presents small font sizes and the Tk
default scheme of black on gray. So for my personal use I made the
fonts larger and wanted the background color Wheat. See the section on
<a class="reference internal" href="preferences.html#preferences"><em>Defaults and Preferences</em></a>.</p>
<p>PAGE may be terminated with File-&gt;Quit which cleanly stops execution
while saving preferences and window geometry; Control-Q also quits
PAGE cleanly.</p>
<div class="section" id="menus">
<h2>Menus<a class="headerlink" href="#menus" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The main menu of PAGE contains some of the usual stuff and there is
nothing too surprising in the File, Edit, or Window menus.  There are
several PAGE windows which appear for various functions and the user
can relocate them and change their sizes with the mouse.  The Save
Window Locations item in the Window menu saves the current locations
for future invocations of PAGE. Quitting PAGE does so also.</p>
<p>The Widget menu is a context menu, a popup menu, providing functions
depending on the widget selected. The popup menu is activated by
selecting a widget from either the GUI window or the Widget Tree with
Button-3. It allows the invocation of things like the Menu editor, or
Page editor for the TNotebook widget. It also allows the user to do
stuff like cut, copy, paste, and delete the widget. A new facility in
4.8 is to expand a widget to fill its container. Finally, it opens the
Binding Editor. The top element of the popup menu selects a submenu
containing commands appropriate to the widget.</p>
<p>The Widget popup appears below:</p>
<img alt="_images/widget-menu.png" src="_images/widget-menu.png" />
<p>The Gen_Python menu creates the Python code for the GUI module as well
as the supporting module. It also loads existing modules into Python
Console windows or into a user specified IDE.</p>
<p>Finally, the Help menu opens an About window containing some
information about PAGE and can open the html version of the this
documentation in the default browser. This has been tested in Linux
with Firefox and Chrome, in OSX with Firefox and Safari, and XP with
Firefox (I don&#8217;t have a reasonable version of IE).</p>
<p>Let me emphasize that PAGE will contain bugs. So be sure to save
often. That is a purpose of the save commands in the File menu.</p>
<p>Many of interface elements like the Widget Toolbar, the Attribute
Editor, and the Widget Tree can be turned on from the Window item of
the main toolbar. Others are invoked from the widget menu after a
widget is selected.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="widget-toolbar">
<h2>Widget Toolbar<a class="headerlink" href="#widget-toolbar" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Widget Toolbar is where one obtains widgets for inclusion in the
GUI. One begins building a GUI by selecting Toplevel with Button-1 and
a blank toplevel window appears on the screen.  To add widgets to the
toplevel, click on the widget in the toolbar and then click in the
parent.  The upper left hand corner of the widget appears at the spot
where the user clicked.</p>
<p>The Widget Toolbar appears below:</p>
<img alt="_images/widget.png" src="_images/widget.png" />
<p>Clicking on the gray bands causes the corresponding section to
collapse or expand.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="attribute-editor">
<h2>Attribute Editor<a class="headerlink" href="#attribute-editor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When one selects a widget the Attribute Editor displays all attributes
of that widget.  The plum colored fields are not writable the others
are. For instance, the Attribute Editor shown below allows one to
change the title from &#8220;New Toplevel 1&#8221; to something more
meaningful. That field is used to generate the Python
class name for the GUI.</p>
<img alt="_images/attribute.jpg" src="_images/attribute.jpg" />
<p>There is the Alias field which is writable by the user.  The user can
provide an alias to improve the readability of the generated code.</p>
<blockquote>
<div></div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="widget-tree">
<span id="widgettree"></span><h2>Widget Tree<a class="headerlink" href="#widget-tree" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Widget Tree shows all of widgets created by PAGE and how they are
nested within their parent widgets, see below. The labels in the tree
show the widget class as well as the program alias used in the
generated Python code.</p>
<img alt="_images/widget-tree.png" src="_images/widget-tree.png" />
<p>The above tree shows that the selected widget is a Button nested in a
Frame that is the first tab of a TNotebook within the Toplevel window.
The alias which appears in the generated Python code for the Button is
Button3; the Frame, Second; the TNotebook, TNotebook1; and finally the
Toplevel window is implemented by the Python class - Special.</p>
<p>The Widget Tree is a very convenient place to select a widget with
Button-1 especially for selecting widgets within more complex widgets
like TNotebooks. I frequently use this window to select the widget I
want to modify and occasionally it fails to select the widget,
particularly when doing copy and paste operations.  For unknown
reasons, if I go and select another widget and then reselect the
widget I want, it usually works.</p>
<p>When you make a change which should appear in the Widget Tree, the Widget tree
may not be updated until you hit the update button in the upper left
of the Widget Tree. The number of such cases has been reduced.</p>
<p>As described below in the section <a class="reference internal" href="use.html#use"><em>Using PAGE</em></a>, the Widget Tree is very
important when trying to move or select some of the more complex
widgets like paned windows or scrolled windows.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bindings-window">
<h2>Bindings Window<a class="headerlink" href="#bindings-window" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This window which appears when Bindings is selected from the Widget
menu allows one to add an event one of the possible bindings shown for
the widget and to specify the associated action.  In the image below
the event &lt;Button-2&gt; has been added for a Button widget and
&#8220;button_handler2&#8221; is specified for the action.</p>
<img alt="_images/button-bind.png" src="_images/button-bind.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="menu-editor">
<h2>Menu Editor<a class="headerlink" href="#menu-editor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This window easily builds a menu.  You can see below an example of its
use.</p>
<img alt="_images/menu.jpg" src="_images/menu.jpg" />
<p>It is called forth from the Widget menus or from the Attribute
editor. I made the selected menu entry with weird colors and fonts to
confirm that such is possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="preferences-window">
<h2>Preferences Window<a class="headerlink" href="#preferences-window" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Preferences Window allows one to set some PAGE preferences.
I considered removing the Preferences Window completely, but on
further thought I realized that the this is indeed a complex subject
involving preferences for both PAGE and the GUI generated by
page. Please see the section on         <a class="reference internal" href="preferences.html#preferences"><em>Defaults and Preferences</em></a>.</p>
<p>The Colors tab of the Preferences Window is shown below:</p>
<img alt="_images/colors.png" src="_images/colors.png" />
<p>In version 4.6, the IDE entry command has been added to support the
new function of opening the users favorite IDE with stored versions of
the GUI and support modules. You will notice that the example shows
the full path of the IdleX.</p>
<p>The Basics tab of the Preferences Window is shown below:</p>
<img alt="_images/basics.png" src="_images/basics.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="python-console">
<span id="id1"></span><h2>Python Console<a class="headerlink" href="#python-console" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When the user generates Python for either the GUI module or the
support module as described above, a separate Python Console window
appears with the generated code inside the upper text box. Thus one
can see both the GUI module and the support module side by side as of
version 4.6.</p>
<p>The Python Console has the following appearance:</p>
<img alt="_images/console.jpg" src="_images/console.jpg" />
<p>The upper text box contains the generated text with a bit of
colorization applied; it is editable. The lower text box contains any
generated output from running the source program. The Python Console
is a ttk::panedwindow which allows one to move the sash between the
two text boxes.</p>
<p>To execute the generated Python module, just click on the Run button
of the &#8216;Python console&#8217;.  Unless you have written the necessary
functions not much will happen other than providing a preview of the
GUI. The skeletal functions that are generated automatically for
callbacks print the function name in the Execution Output window using
the Print function.  On Linux or OS X the function name will appear
immediately in the execution window; on Windows, when execution is
terminated.  The Print function works fine for Python 2.7 or 3.x. See
the penultimate paragraph of this section which discusses this
more. As explained in the  <a class="reference internal" href="rework.html#rework"><em>Rework</em></a> section, the GUI module will
not execute unless there is a existing support module. If the GUI code
has been modified to include new callbacks then one shouldn&#8217;t expect
the GUI code to execute until those callbacks have been incorporated
in the support module.</p>
<p>There are several buttons along the bottom of the window. They behave
as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Save - Saves the contents of the upper text box into a file. It also saves the tcl file.</li>
<li>Run - Attempts to execute the GUI source module even if the displayed code is the Python support module. It also may save the Python and the tcl file. The shortcut for run is &lt;Control-r&gt;.</li>
<li>Close - Closes the Python console.  The shortcut is &lt;Control-w&gt;.</li>
</ul>
<p>The upper text box can be modified (edited) by selecting a character
position with the mouse and typing. Such changes will be saved with
either the Save or Run buttons.</p>
<p>As you can imagine the colorization is not fancy. Keywords, comments,
and strings are set to distinct colors. The defaults are set to
reasonable colors for light backgrounds. One place you may have
trouble is with quotes that bracketed by &#8216;&#8217;&#8217; or &#8220;&#8221;&#8221;. You should start
a line with one of these delimiters and end a following line with one.</p>
<p>The Run Button attempts a trial run on your GUI. If you have enough
skeleton functions in the support module and there are no errors in
the generated code, you should see the python code executed and the
GUI window will appear. From there you close the Python window go back
to PAGE and refine the GUI by moving widgets around, adding additional
widgets, or changing attributes.</p>
<p>A problem was reported when users attempt to resize the window. Recent
changes allow the window to gracefully resize. This can be necessary
if the screen resolution will not allow the entire window to be
displayed. When the window is made smaller, it may appear to loose the
Execution pane. However, it can be recovered by moving up the sash of
the paned window.  When one quits and restarts PAGE after resizing the
Python console, the new size will have been saved in ~/.pagerc and
used when subsequently invoking the Python console including the
placement of the sash. So invoke the Python console, resize it,
re-position the sash quit PAGE, and restart PAGE to use the new Python
console.</p>
<p>Also, scroll wheel support in the Python console works.  To use the
scroll wheel in Windows one must focus on the desired pane
first. Finally, when the Python Console is in focus, Control-P and
Control-U will have the effect of generating the GUI module and the
supporting module respectively.</p>
<p>Execution of the python module on Linux communicates with the console
through pipes; thus output from the execution now appears immediately
in the Execution Output pane.  Coupled with a recent change which
embeds a print statement in the generated dummy functions, if a user
specifies a command for a button, for example, and generates the
python and runs it from the Python Console, and selects the button,
the name of the command will appear in the Execution Console.  This is
useful because no output from selecting the widget means that you have
not defined a callback function. Unfortunately, on Windows the this
output does not appear until the execution terminates.  (I have not
been able to get Tcl pipes to work with Windows. I would appreciate
help or suggestions.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="color-dialog">
<span id="id2"></span><h2>Color Dialog<a class="headerlink" href="#color-dialog" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are many cases where when setting preferences in the Preferences
window or attributes for a widget in the Attribute Editor one selects
a little button with an ellipsis and the invokes a color dialog window:</p>
<img alt="_images/colorpicker.png" src="_images/colorpicker.png" />
<p>When this window pops up you are given several different ways of
selecting a color:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Pick a color in the multicolored window with your mouse.</li>
<li>Enter values in the Red, Green, and Blue entry fields.</li>
<li>Enter an Hex color value such as #f5deb3 in the Color entry field. That is the color wheat.</li>
<li>Enter a color name such as wheat in the Color entry field.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="colors">
<h2>Colors<a class="headerlink" href="#colors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Since PAGE is aimed at using ttk widgets which will obey the canned
themes which are basically black on gray, I want the background of
created windows to be gray.  Unless you are prepared to work with
themes, I recommend that you stay with the tk default colors.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dual-monitors">
<h2>Dual Monitors<a class="headerlink" href="#dual-monitors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One user reported a problem involving dual monitors where he had
opened PAGE with dual monitors set up with the second monitor to the
right of the main monitor.  He then dragged one of the PAGE windows to
the monitor on the right.  Later he disconnected the second monitor
and reopened PAGE and was unable to see the window displayed on the
nonexistent monitor.  Version 4.8 attempts to fix this problem by
relocating the wayward window in its default position.  I have tested
this code in a Windows virtual machine but do not have the hardware to
test it on either Linux or OSX.  I would appreciate any information
from users using Dual monitors.</p>
